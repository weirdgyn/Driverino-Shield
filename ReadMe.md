# Driverino-Shield

### (italian noun) /ˈdraɪvərnəʊ/ : *little driver*

Driverino-Shield is a simple, low power, controller for [BLDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushless_DC_electric_motor) sensored motors.
The aim of the project was to create an Arduino shield to drive PM BLDC motor(s) rated about 50-100W.
The board is designed around TI MCT8316Z BLDC chip: a very compact full featured driver that can be easily controlled from Arduino microcontroller.

PCB has been fully designed with KiCAD.
